# 🧠 Employee Churn Prediction

Predicting which employees are likely to leave a company using machine learning. This project aims to help HR teams make data-driven decisions and improve employee retention.

## 📌 Project Overview

In this project, I built a machine learning model that predicts employee churn (whether an employee will leave or stay). The model is trained on historical employee data and can help companies take proactive actions to retain valuable talent.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Employee turnover can cost a company time, money, and productivity. By using predictive analytics, we can:
- Identify at-risk employees
- Understand contributing factors to churn
- Take preventative actions

## 🚀 Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.)
- Accuracy comparison between models
- Confusion matrix and classification report
- Visualization of key insights

## 📊 Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🏃‍♂️ How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Cngh10/employee-churn-prediction.git
   cd employee-churn-prediction
